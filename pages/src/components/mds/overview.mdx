# Method Overview (FDVS)

We propose **Fine-Detailed Video Story generation (FDVS)**, a novel framework for long video understanding that converts videos into hierarchical textual representations. FDVS addresses two key challenges in long video understanding: complex long-context relationship modeling and interference from redundancy. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple video understanding tasks without requiring task-specific fine-tuning.

## Key Contributions
1. Bottom-up Video Interpretation Mechanism: Progressively interprets video content from clips to full video, enabling comprehensive understanding of long videos.

2. Semantic Redundancy Reduction: Eliminates redundant information at both visual and textual levels to improve efficiency and accuracy.

3. Hierarchical Textual Representations: Generates multi-granularity descriptions (clip chapters and full video stories) that are interpretable and applicable to various downstream tasks.
