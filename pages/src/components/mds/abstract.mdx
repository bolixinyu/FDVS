# Abstract

Long video understanding has become a critical task in computer vision, driving advancements across numerous applications from surveillance to content retrieval. Existing video understanding methods suffer from two challenges when dealing with long video understanding: intricate long-context relationship modeling and interference from redundancy. To tackle these challenges, we introduce Fine-Detailed Video Story generation (FDVS), which interprets long videos into detailed textual repre- sentations. Specifically, to achieve fine-grained modeling of long- temporal content, we propose a Bottom-up Video Interpretation Mechanism that progressively interprets video content from clips to video. To avoid interference from redundant information in videos, we introduce a Semantic Redundancy Reduction mechanism that removes redundancy at both the visual and textual levels. Our method transforms long videos into hier- archical textual representations that contain multi-granularity information of the video. With these representations, FDVS is applicable to various tasks without any fine-tuning. We evaluate the proposed method across eight datasets spanning three tasks. The performance demonstrates the effectiveness and versatility of our method.
